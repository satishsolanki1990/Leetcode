Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).

The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e, âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).

You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

        # Will klogn > n log k or vice versa?  
        # i think so too! let's use mathss

        # k log n -> n is 10000 and k is 3. 12
        # 10000 log(3) = 477.12  yours is better definitely! AH butt
        # It's interesting!! Will have to do a deeper analysis 
        # yeahh. It is .
